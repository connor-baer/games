  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(card_game)" target="_blank"
      >Wizard</a
    > is a trick-taking card game for {MIN_PLAYERS} to {MAX_PLAYERS} players designed
    by Ken Fisher of Toronto, Ontario in 1984.
  </p>
  <p>
    The objective of the game is to bid correctly on the number of tricks that a
    player will take in the subsequent round of play. Points are awarded for a
    correct bid and subtracted for an incorrect bid. The player with the most
    points after all rounds have been played is the winner.
  </p>
  <p>
    This digital scorekeeper mimics the traditional scorecards, adding
    validation and automatic point calculation.
